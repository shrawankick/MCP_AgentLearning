# MCP_AgentLearning

This is mainly to learn about how we configure the MCP server and we are trying to use Fast MCP 2.0 


pip install fastmcp

Creating a virtual environment 
python -m venv .venv 

Running a virtual environment 
source .venv/bin/activate
If we find some errors, maybe this would be a workaround 
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
